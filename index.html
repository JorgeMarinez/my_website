      <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <p>Hi my name is Jorge Marinez. I have three associates degrees from Cabrillo College in Computer Science, Chemistry, and Biology. 
         I am currently considering options for a university to finish my last two years.  I was born in beautiful Santa Cruz, California. 
         My favorite hobbies are exercising, reading, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. </p>
